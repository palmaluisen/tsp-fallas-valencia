# 2025 Fallas Route Project in Valencia, Spain

This is an interactive project developed with **Streamlit**, **OR-Tools**, **OSRM**, and **TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)** to find the most efficient route to visit the Fallas of 2025 in Valencia, Spain. The application allows users to plan the optimal route to visit various Fallas locations, using distances calculated by OSRM.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to help tourists and attendees of the Fallas in Valencia optimize their route through the city, maximizing the efficiency of their visit using a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) approach. Through an interactive user interface built with Streamlit, users can input their begin location and get the optimal route to visit the fallas.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Streamlit**: A framework for creating interactive web applications in Python.
- **OR-Tools**: A Google library for solving combinatorial problems like TSP, used to calculate the optimal route.
- **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)**: A tool that calculates distances and travel times between geographic points using real routes.
- **Pandas**: For handling and processing Fallas data.
- **GeoPandas**: For working with geospatial data.
